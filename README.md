# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This week I was tasked with fixing a broken password generator.  I really had to think about how I wanted to approach this project, I spent a while going down a rabbithole only to discover it wasn't the way I wanted to go.  The password generator will now generate a password depeding on the specified criteria the user inputs.  I also spent some time working on validation checking to make sure that there were no unexpected outcomes when dealing with user inputs.
